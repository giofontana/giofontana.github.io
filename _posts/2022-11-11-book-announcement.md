It's been a long road to get here, but we can finally make this announcement! Our new book OpenShift Multi-Cluster Management Handbook is going to be released soon! It is available for [preorder on Amazon already](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG5B6MK2/).

Our initial goal with OpenShift Multi-Cluster Management Handbook was to cover a wide range of topics that we found relevant while performing OpenShift-related activities in our career. We have been working for years with a variety of different tasks, such as clusters deployment, architectural design, troubleshooting, and others related to OpenShift, during this time we were able to accumulate experiences and lessons learned, such as:
* The main challenges many companies face when adopting public cloud;
* Common pitfalls with OpenShift adoption;
* Architectural best practices;
* Security concerns and best practices;
* Main personas that work with OpenShift, their expectations, challenges, and key responsibilities;

Our intention with this book was not only to provide technical content to help you learn about new topics but also to cover some topics that you can usually only learn on the job, with practical experience. Additionally, you will discover some up-to-date materials that will assist you to survive in this world of several OpenShift clusters living on multiple platforms, from on-premise to the cloud, using tools that make up the OpenShift Plus offering - Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, Advanced Cluster Security, and Quay.

It was our first time writing a book, and we are not even native English speakers, so we can definitely say it was a real challenge for us! This book is the result of many late nights and intensive research. But writing was not the only challenge: our family and closest friends know some of the real challenges we had during this journey, just to name a few: we both have our roles changed at Red Hat, one of the writers was relocated to a different city, and the other moved even farther away - to another country! So many new things in our personal and professional lives - not once or twice that we considered giving up, but, as the wise [Master Yoda says: "Do or do not, there is no try."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SNAluOj6U)

We persisted, and after several months, we finally can say we succeeded! Here it is, the finished book, we hope you enjoy it and find it useful on your journey! Although we would be quite grateful if it becomes a good-selling book, our major goal will have been accomplished and we will feel that the several late hours were worthwhile if it helped even just one person get better outcomes.

So, we encourage you to [check out our book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG5B6MK2/). If you want to get in touch, add us to your social network, GitHub, and join [Packt Community Platform](https://community.packt.com/register/)!
