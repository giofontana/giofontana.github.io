title:  "Nothing is permanent except change!"
summary:  "This quote, attributed to Heraclites, Greek philosopher who innovated in his time declaring that the world and nature are in constant movement and nothing is static, everything moves and changes, also author of the proverb “no man ever steps in the same river twice”, which refers to how neither are the same as they were before — made me consider the number of changes that my family and I experienced this year.… uhhh, what a year so far! For my family and I, everything has changed: my home, my country, new friends, new routines! Everything is brand new again!"

My family and I made a significant change in our lives in May of this year: We relocated from my home country of sunny and warm Brazil to the lovely, historical, and cold — at least for me! — New England, more specifically Massachusetts. It is difficult to leave behind friends, family, and my country, but we have decided to take on this challenge.

During this transition period, we faced numerous challenges — I’m still wondering whether or not to write a separate post about it (what do you think?) — but difficulties ranging from financing and rental due to a lack of a credit score to unexpected emotional instability due to the distance from family and friends. I left home when I was 18 years old to attend university, and a few years later I moved to another city to work. I also had to travel quite frequently for work at some point in my life, and I assumed that because of these and other factors, it would not be as difficult, emotionally speaking, to deal with the many things that a change like this generates. But this time was different: seeing my son cry because he can’t play with his friends or stay close to our family hurts so much! I felt the weight of responsibility on my shoulders and wondered many times if I had made the right decision.

But as time passes, we gradually overcome the challenges and adapt to the new reality. I feel that we will always miss our home country, but the experiences we have had here in these few months have been priceless! We were able to experience the intensity of summer here, as well as the splendor of nature in the fall, with its incredible red, yellow, and colorful leaves!

We are now eagerly awaiting the arrival of winter with a mixture of excitement and anxiety; we are from a warm country, so perhaps this will be our most difficult challenge here?!?! I’m not sure, but that’s what we’re going to look into soon! :)

So, how about you? How do you deal with life changes? Comment and share!
